The bandwidth is the range of frequencies available for data transmission within a communication channel. It's measured in Hertz (Hz) and represents the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies that a channel can support.

Another way to define it is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a specific time, typically its referred to in bits per seconds though it can be spoken of in terms of kilobits, megabits and gigabits per second too.

Key points.
- It's important to make the distinction that bandwidth is not the same thing as internet speed. To better explain this lets think of a highway road. The width of the road is the bandwidth and the amount of cars actually using the road is the internet speed
