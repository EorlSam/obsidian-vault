## Components
- Node – Any device connected to a network, such as computers, routers, and switches.
- Host / End System – A device where network communication starts or ends, like a computer or server.
- Intermediate Node – Devices that facilitate data transfer between nodes, such as routers and switches.
- Switch – A device that forwards data to specific devices within a network based on MAC addresses.
- Router – A device that directs data between different networks by determining the best path.
- Links – The physical or wireless connections that transmit data between nodes.
- Application – Software running on networked devices that communicate through the network to exchange data.
