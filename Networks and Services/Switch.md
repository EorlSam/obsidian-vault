A network switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching and MAC addresses to receive and forward data to the destination device.

It has some key benefits over other forms of data transmission:
- Efficiency: if the switch contains the destination MAC address it can send the data packet only to the intended device, in contrast, other devices like hubs send the data frame to all devices in the network.
- MAC Address Learning: switches store a
